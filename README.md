# slp-mutable-data

This is a JavaScript library that is packaged with browserify, to make it accessible to both browser-based and node.js-based programs. It allows Bitcoin Cash (BCH) wallets to retrieve a document from IPFS that represents the mutable data associated with an SLP token.

This library implements this [PS002 specification for mutable data](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/specifications/blob/master/ps002-slp-mutable-data.md). It follows a series of pointers on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain to retrieve a JSON file from the IPFS network. This is a way to track changing data associated with a token. It's a way for video game characters, supply chain items, and other unique changing assets to be represented by a token.
